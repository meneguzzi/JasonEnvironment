This is a utility package including a implementations of various Jason 
environments aimed at facilitating the modular development of an agent system.
One of these environments is driven by a script to generate new perception 
events at specific times during the execution of a Jason multiagent system. 
Class ScriptedEnvironment takes as a parameter an XML file with nodes 
containing a list of perceptual updates for all agents and the time at which 
these updates must be sent to all agents in the environment. An example
script is located at examples/script.xml.
